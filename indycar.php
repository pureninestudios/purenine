			<p>The League’s premier series was named the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series in 2003. The series initially raced exclusively on oval tracks, as the series was founded partly in response to the increasing prominence of road and street courses on the CART schedule. In 2005, the series abandoned its unofficial ovals-only stance, and added three road–street course events. By 2009, the series had a roughly 50/50 split of ovals and road/street courses. Presently, the series currently runs 1/3rd of its schedule on ovals and the rest on road and street circuits.</p>
