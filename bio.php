			<p>The network originally launched in 1999 as The Biography Channelâ€”an off-shoot of the A&E television series Biography. As such, it originally featured factual programs, such as reruns of its namesake. As A&E shifted its focus towards reality and drama series, Biography Channel became the home for several series that had been displaced by the network (including Biography itself), but shifted towards reality-oriented series itself in 2007 with a re-brand as simply Bio.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We helped design the new biography.com. They wanted to have a fresh look for the new site.  All designs were created while employed by A&E Networks.</p>
