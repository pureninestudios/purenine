                                Tired of using premium stock photos in your design projects? Well, we have a solution for you. We gathered
                                70+ great galleries with free high quality stock photos. Read further to discover them all.
                            </h4>
                            <p>When we develop a premium theme we use premium stock photos, at least we used it till now in full meaning of this word. Every
                                image on our premium themes was premium stock photography. Well, we decided to change that. Why? Simply because we want to
                                offer more quality to our buyers and some stock photos are so cold and impersonal and unnatural. Of course, we still use premium
                                images in some portion, but far less then before. </p>

                            <p>Till few months or maybe a few years back (one or two years), there simply wasn’t enough free high quality images that you could use
                                in your web design project. With arising galleries that offer free high quality photos that changed. There is still lack of free
                                photos for shop products, if you are making a template for a shop, you still need a premium stock photos. The same is for team members,
                                etc., but all of this images your client/our buyer probably won’t use in his own design. Why? Because we believe if he has a company
                                that he wants to place images of his own employees, not some random stock photo that every other site is using...</p>
                            <p>But why are free photos good then? Free photos are excellent for bloggers and online magazines. They feel natural and personal in some
                                way and we love to use them for that type of sites. Even this template uses a large amount of free photos. So the question is then,
                                where can you find free photos? Well, it’s been weeks now since we published our blog post about galleries that offer free images. We
                                collected 70+ really great sites that are offering beautiful images in high resolutions and most of them are licensed under C00 license,
                                which means you can use them in any way you like - for both personal and commercial projects. Why we did that list? The first reason were
                                our buyers. They bought the theme, saw that images are not included and wonder if there are some free images they could use. Although we
                                give links to premium images used in every theme in our documentation, we decided to make a step further. Investigate free images that are
                                high quality and useful. We wrote a blog post that covers our favorite galleries which we use now and another list of other great ones. We
                                found that our buyers found it useful and hope you will to. So head over to our official site and discover all 70+ sites offering free high
                                quality photos!</p>
